# WorldLib

A simple wrapper to all that is worldbox. This allows you to mess with core systems without inside-out knowledge of the entire worldbox codebase.

## Installation

Download BepInEx to the game folder and start the game once. Then you will see a Bepinex/plugins folder in your game files. Put the DLL file in there and restart the game. You have now installed WorldLib!
